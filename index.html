        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political ScienceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Passionate about justice, advocacy, and making a meaningful impact, I am a Political Science student at the University of California, Riverside, with aspirations of becoming a lawyer or criminal investigator. My academic journey has been shaped by a deep curiosity about law, governance, and the systems that shape our society. Growing up, I was always fascinated by the way laws govern behavior, establish rights, and define justice. I am particularly interested in areas such as criminology, forensic psychology, and immigration lawâ€”fields that allow me to understand human behavior, crime, and social justice from a multidisciplinary perspective.
        </p>
        
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Throughout my studies, I have focused on political institutions, legal frameworks, and how legal systems both protect and challenge individualsâ€™ rights in society. My interest in law deepened as I learned about political movements, legal structures, and the complexities of the justice system. This journey reinforced my belief that law is not just about rules; itâ€™s about people, fairness, and the pursuit of truth. I am especially drawn to areas that directly affect the marginalized and vulnerable. Through my coursework and experiences, Iâ€™ve gained insight into how laws can either serve as a shield or a barrier. This realization has made me determined to pursue a career that helps those who feel unheardâ€”to advocate for those whose voices often go unnoticed. I am committed to using my knowledge and skills to create a meaningful difference in communities that need it most.
        </p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">
          College has also shaped me into someone who deeply values resilience and lifelong learning. The challenges Iâ€™ve faced throughout my education have taught me that success is not solely about intelligence; itâ€™s about perseverance, adaptability, and the willingness to push beyond oneâ€™s comfort zone. My experiences have reinforced my belief that growth comes from overcoming adversityâ€”whether that means seeking help when needed or facing a difficult challenge head-on. As I continue my studies, I remain dedicated to learning not only from professors but from the experiences and perspectives of my peers. I seek opportunities to grow both academically and personally.
        </p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Alongside my academic and career goals, I also have a passion for creative expression and entrepreneurship. I believe that creativity and strategic thinking are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary. My interest in fashion and business demonstrates my ability to approach challenges from multiple angles. Whether in law, criminology, or business, I see a balance between analytical skills and creative problem-solving as essential. This approach extends to how I envision my future career: one that leverages both logic and innovation to make lasting impacts.
        </p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Looking ahead, I want to pursue a career that balances intellectual challenge with real-world impact. Whether Iâ€™m working in a courtroom, conducting criminal investigations, or advocating for immigrant rights, my goal is to use my skills to be a force for positive change. I am especially driven by the desire to create a system that is fairer, more inclusive, and truly just for everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances. At the same time, I hope to inspire others, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds, to pursue their passions without fear and create opportunities where they once seemed impossible.
        </p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">
          For me, success is not just about individual accomplishments. Itâ€™s about giving back, empowering others, and making a lasting impact on the communities around me. As I continue my journey, I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals, mentors, and professionals who share my commitment to justice and social change. With these connections, I hope to continually improve and work toward a better, fairer future for all.
